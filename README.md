### Experimental state management library for react

Redux like state management in react with less boilerplate and a simple to use hook.

I started a project to learn more about event driven functional JS but somehow ended up with this.

The project still has a lot of shortcomings which I will fix as I learn more.

## About

Written in Typescript

Includes a demo react app using the library

No dependency other than react ofc

I wrote all utility functions for deep / shallow diffs, deep copy for arrays / objects from scratch

Has a lot of monkey-patching all over the place which I plan to fix soon
